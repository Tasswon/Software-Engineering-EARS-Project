# Software-Engineering-EARS-Project
Collaborated on a project for a resume review system utilizing Microsoft .NET Framework. 

## The Assigned Problem
EARS is an intranet-based Employment Application Review System for the International School of Software. The system is designed so that school faculty members can review applicants and collaborate asynchronously in order to find the best applicant for a given job opening. This system reduces the overhead of the process and lightens the workload for the search chairperson.
The scope of this project will be to provide a system that allows to:
1. log-in EARS system
2. manage system users (add new accounts)
3. add a new faculty search (committee chair, members, position, search starting date and ending date, add new committee members)
4. List and review applications (view profile, post comments on applicants, change applicants’ statues, perform a faculty review, assign faculty review)
5. set account’s settings (email, name, title, password)
Different users might need various functionalities.
